# 🎨 Personal
I was born in December and I am a Sagittarius who is naturally in love with freedom.

My MBTI is `INTJ`. I enjoy being alone and love traveling around the world.

My favorite quote is: **我与我周旋久，宁作我**  —《世说新语》

When it comes to sports, I like volleyball and hiking.

In terms of literary and entertainment activities, I like watching plays, musicals, stand-up comedies, etc. In my spare time, I also dance and draw.

I like playing scripted `murder mystery games` and watching detective variety shows.
