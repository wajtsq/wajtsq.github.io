# üëΩ Personal

Born in the chilly embrace of January, I'm an Aquarius. 
My MBTI says I'm an INFJ, but honestly, I'm just an ambivert with a sprinkle of everything. 
I'm all about philosophy, psychology, and sociology, and I run a WeChat public account called `Á¨¨NÈù¢Â¢ô`.
Join me there for some mind-bending discussions.
My dream is to wander the cosmos.
And my current favorite quote: **Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom. - Soren Kierkegaard**.

When it comes to sports, I jive with basketball, badminton, and hiking; 
as for the arts, musicals, dramas, and impressionist art make my heart sing. 
My all-time favorite movies? `Mr. Nobody` and `The Before Trilogy`. 
I'm a fan of puzzle games such as the `Rusty Lake` series, and lately, I've been playing `Valorant`.
