I am pleased to have contributed to [BrainWave](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10251), my first published research paper. This research introduces the first foundation model for both invasive and non-invasive neural recordings, composed of three main components: embedding layer, Transformer encoder and channel attention. This model will facilitate a wide range of clinical
applications in medicine, paving the way for AI-driven approaches to investigate brain disorders and advance neuroscience research.

We aim to establish a universal model for brain signals, enhancing performance in various downstream tasks within the healthcare domain 
while empowering a quantitative understanding of brain activity in neuroscience for human.

Starting from a real medical scenario—seizure detection, our goal is to automatically identify epileptic waves in intracranial brain signals 
for medication-resistant patients, expediting the localization of lesions within the brain. Inspired by neuroscience research, we initially 
attempt to model the diffusion patterns of epileptic waves for individual patients ([BrainNet, KDD'22](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13101)). 
Subsequently, we employ self-supervised learning to capture universal spatio-temporal correlations between signals from different brain regions, 
facilitating generalization to different patients ([MBrain, KDD'23](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13102); 
[PPi, NeurIPS'23](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=tEmFyqjaJh); DMNet, NeurIPS'24).

To construct a foundational model, we first attempt to pretrain a foundational model with 500M parameters based on a large volume of 
intracranial brain signals ([Brant, NeurIPS'23](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=DDkl9vaJyE)). Subsequently, we integrate EEG into the pretraining corpus, 
building a foundational model with 1B parameters, thereby generalizing to a broader range of downstream tasks such as sleep staging and 
emotion recognition ([Brant-2, arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10251)). Leveraging the strong generalization of Brant-2, we propose a 
unified alignment framework ([Brant-X, KDD'24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3637528.3671953)) to rapidly adapt Brant-2 to downstream tasks 
involving rare physiological signals (e.g., EOG/ECG/EMG).
In our pursuit to construct a universal foundational model, we recognize the necessity for a comprehensive dataset encompassing a wide array of domains. 
Given the scarcity of brain signal data, we explore a diffusion-based model for intracranial brain signals generation (NeuralDiff, under review). Furthermore, 
we innovate to directly synthesize infinite sequences, thereby circumventing the dependence on actual data ([InfoBoost, arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00607)).

To enhance mutual understanding and trust between humans and machines, we first propose a consistency learning framework that enables models 
to understand human input and adaptively harmonize annotations from different individuals ([Con4m, NeurIPS'24](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00041)). 
Additionally, we are developing connections between foundational models and human-understandable modalities, and exploring interactive learning 
between models and humans.
